# IDAPython_Script
Script for IDAPython to detect possible cypher functions

Phase 1: List all functions and their assembly code
Phase 2: List all functions with loops
  First iteration: List all functions with possible loops
  Second iteration: Verify loops of the first iteration
Phase 3: List all functions with possible cipher algorithm
